This project is no longer actively developed, so check out the forks for more recent versions.

Some nice updates and refactors were made in the [`dwayne/builtwithelm`](https://github.com/dwayne/builtwithelm) fork, so the domain `builtwithelm.co` points to that project as of February 2021. That may be a good place to start with exploring forks of this repo!
